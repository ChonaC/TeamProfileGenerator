# TeamProfileGenerator

## Description:
This application allows the user to input employee informations in order to keep his/her roster orgranized and up to date. The command line will first ask the user the name, Id, and email of the new employee. Once the user has entered each information, the command line will ask the user to choose between Manager, Intern, or Engineer. Each option will ask the user a question that is different from the other two. For example, when the user chooses Manager, the command line will ask for name, ID, email, and office number. The other two will ask the first three questions but for Intern it will ask for the school and for Engineer, it will ask for their github username. The user will have the option to choose whether they would like to add another employee, if yes, then the full set of questions will be ask again. If the user chooses no, then the application will end, and the it will let the user know that the html file is updated. This will then append to the html file or it will create an html file if there is none.
